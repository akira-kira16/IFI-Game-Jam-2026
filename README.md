In this project, we have coded a game from scratch using PyGame in Python.
This has taught us how basic game coding works, and given us a further intuition into how the mechanics work.

You play as a charcter that has watched their loved ones die from a mysterious and deadly entity that is endlessly growing.

Will you escape the entity, or will it consume you?
